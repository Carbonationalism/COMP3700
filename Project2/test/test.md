### Testing Video

I just do all of my testing in one video, and it's like 4 minutes so maybe watch it on 2x speed

In the video I just go through various use cases. I first login on an admin user and use that to create a new customer user, then login on that customer user and view its purchase history and make a purchase. Then I login on a cashier user, view the total purchase history, and delete that purchase and make a new one. Then I log in on a manager user and mess around with products and customers.

All CRUD by the application is done through the StoreServer that's running separately in the background. I show starting up the server and choosing the local database for the server to work with at the beginning of the video.
